# EPOCH-ALPS
EPOCH-ALPS project explores how glacier retreat alters mercury fluxes in alpine lakes. By combining sediment cores, geochemical analyses and climate data, the project disentangles anthropogenic from climate-driven mercury sources, quantifies historical fluxes and assesses implications for ecosystem recovery and environmental policy.
